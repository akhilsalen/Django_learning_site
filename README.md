# Django_learning_site
inspired by the idea of pythonprogrammin.net by sendex



in this project  i included all django dynamic page rendering and  cred operations ,
also used tinymce for textarea for more added functionality . homepage is simple . the models are difficult it goes around models and views  
the complex view might be confusing but as i begineer i did best to learn the topic . dynamic routing is fun factor . i added meterilise for css . 
took my time to learn and resolve all the runtime errors in the models area . 


the key functionality include categorised topics on few programminfg languages . as of now the database contains only few information and new data of tutorias 
can only pushed through the adminpage 
 in the future i will improve the code learn more from more practice 
 i am also planinh to host with database support    on free hosting sites
